# **Payment Data Modeling with dbt and DuckDB**  

Status : on-going 

Welcome to my project on **Data Modeling Payment Data** using **dbt Core** and **DuckDB**!  

In this project, I demonstrate advanced **dbt best practices** while building a robust data model for payment data. Going beyond the fundamentals, I explore and implement:  
- **Layered Data Modeling**: Clear and structured implementation for staging, intermediate, and final models.  
- **Custom Macros**: Efficient and reusable SQL for complex transformations.  
- **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive tests and detailed documentation for a reliable and transparent data pipeline.  
- **Complex Data Handling**: Techniques for managing JSON data, timestamps, and other non-standard data types.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Practical strategies to enhance query performance and scalability.  

This repository is a hands-on exploration of best practices and advanced features in dbt, designed to serve as a reference for anyone looking to elevate their data engineering workflows.
